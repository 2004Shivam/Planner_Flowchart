# Career Planner: 15-Month Advanced Engineering Roadmap

This is a comprehensive, thesis-level career and learning execution plan designed specifically for bridging the gap between basic coding and advanced systems engineering. 

The roadmap focuses on transforming a student into an elite engineering asset capable of securing 15-20 LPA roles in the product-based market.

## Key Features
- **15-Month Structured Execution**: Day-by-day, week-by-week granularity.
- **Strict AI Governance**: Phased AI usage policies to rebuild logical reasoning.
- **Core Skill Spine**: Deep focus on Python (fundamentals), Go (systems/concurrency), and TypeScript (production interfaces).
- **Killer Project Portfolio**: 3 production-grade, distributed systems projects.
- **Interactive Flowchart**: Track progress, visualize dependencies, and manage learning milestones.

## Running Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

2. **Start Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser**:
   Navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5174`).

## Architecture
Built with **Vite + React + XYFlow**. Styling is powered by **Tailwind CSS** with a custom design system for high-stakes focus.

## Philosophy
- **Output-Driven Theory**: Learn exactly what you need to build the next module.
- **Friction-as-a-Feature**: Struggle is deliberate to ensure deep internalization.
- **Black Box Ban**: No using tools you haven't understood at a lower level.
